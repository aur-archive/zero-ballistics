<H1 CLASS="western">Release Notes</H1>

<P>Zero Ballistics is a purely multiplayer-oriented game, and does not
feature a single-player part. When you host a game, your local server
will try to contact our game master server and publicly list your
game.</P>

you can change the resolution directly in config.xml.

3d-acceleration enabled for both displays, or you will experience
choppy motion.

<P>After installing and starting the game the main menu comes up and
offers a range of possibilities that are explained in detail here:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><B>Host Game: </B>Starts a local server with the specified
	settings and immediately connects to it. Other players can join this
	server on the specified port. When hosting a game, your local server is
	automatically registered with the game master server.</P>
	<LI><P><B>Join Game:</B> Allows to connect to other servers that are
	currently running Zero Ballistics. You can either list the public
	servers on the internet, LAN servers which are listening on the
	default port, or directly specify an IP address to connect to.</P>
	<LI><P><B>Options: </B>Provides a wide range of settings that are
	related to the game. The settings are divided into 5 categories:
	Game, Video, Audio, Graphics and Keys. <BR/>With the graphics settings

	the game performance can be adjusted to the power of the
	hardware provided. If you experience any performance problems,
	first try to lower the settings for graphics quality
	here. Currently, the game has to be restarted for video and
	graphic changes to take effect.<BR>

        Customize your controls by
	clicking on the &quot;Keys&quot; tab, and change your player name in
	the category &quot;Game&quot;.</P>

handling <A HREF="#2.Game Help|outline"><FONT FACE="Times"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">(up)</SPAN></SPAN></FONT></A></H2>
<P>The tank's body is controlled with standard keys W,S,A,D to drive
forward, backward, left and right. The turret is controlled
independently from the body and follows the movement of the mouse.
Dragging the mouse to the left or to the right results in rotating
the turret, while pushing the mouse forward or pulling it back
controls the vertical alignment of the cannon mounted on the turret.</P>
<P>The tank is equipped with three different weapon systems. The main
gun (default: left mouse button) fires projectiles that follow a
ballistic trajectory, therefore it is necessary to lead the target
and aim higher if it is farther away. This weapon does a fair amount
of damage but the projectiles move with low speed.<BR>The secondary
weapon is a machine gun (default: right mouse button) that fires
high-velocity rounds which have a limited range but follow a straight
line so you should aim directly at your target. The machine gun does
a rather small amount of damage.<BR>Depending on the chosen skill,
tanks are also equipped with a small amount of mines which are
dropped at the rear end of the tank's body (default: F). Mines do a
high amount of damage if another tank runs over them, but can be
destroyed by shooting at them, and have a limited lifetime.</P>
<p>
Your tank also is equipped with a stealth device so you can only be
seen by your enemy's radar when you are firing your main gun!
</p>
<H2 CLASS="western">Weapons and Skills <A HREF="#2.Game Help|outline"><FONT FACE="Times"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">(up)</SPAN></SPAN></FONT></A></H2>
<P>You can select the equipment of your tank in the equipment menu
(default: E). Equip your tank with the weapons and skills that best
fit your playing style! Changes you make here will take effect only
after your next respawn.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="7.Scoring|outline"></A>Scoring <A HREF="#2.Game Help|outline"><FONT FACE="Times"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">(up)</SPAN></SPAN></FONT></A></H2>
<P>The score table (default: TAB) shows each player's score, kills,
deaths, level and ping. Your accuracy and efficiency are displayed as
well. For each kill you are awarded two upgraded points,
substantially weaker or stronger opponents give one or four upgrade
points, respectively.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="8.Upgrades|outline"></A>Upgrades <A HREF="#2.Game Help|outline"><FONT FACE="Times"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">(up)</SPAN></SPAN></FONT></A></H2>
<P>During the game it is possible to upgrade the tank in the three
categories weapon, armor and speed. Each category has three levels
that can be unlocked consecutively by spending upgrade points.
Upgrade points are earned by killing opponents, or helping somebody
else kill an opponent.</P>
<P>The upgrade menu (default: U) shows a short description of each
upgrade, together with upgrade costs that need to be spent to
activate an upgrade. Upgrades can also be activated via hotkeys
(default: 1,2,3). Choose your upgrades wisely to gain an advantage
over your enemies!</P>
